git push Push your changes to the remote repository:

git pull Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository:
    git pull origin <branch>

git branch -r

1. Create a New Branch from origin/main

First, make sure you are up to date with the latest changes from the remote repository. Fetch the updates:

bash

git fetch origin

Then, create a new branch based on origin/main:

bash

git checkout -b new_branch_name origin/main

2. Create a New Branch from Another Branch
If you want to create a new branch from another existing branch (e.g., origin/another_branch), use:

bash

git checkout -b new_branch_name origin/another_branch

3. Switch to Your New Branch

If you’ve already created the new branch and want to switch to it, use:

bash

git checkout new_branch_name

4. Push Your New Branch to Remote
Once you’ve made changes and committed them to your new branch, you can push it to the remote repository:

bash

git push origin new_branch_name



git branch - list, create, delete branch:
    git branch   # List all branches
    git branch <branch_name> # Create a new branch
    git branch -d <branch_name> # Delete a branch

git checkout - Switch to a different branch or restore working tree files:
    git checkout <branch_name> # Switch to a branch
    git checkout -b <branch_name> # Create and switch to a new branch
